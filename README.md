# Express Note Taker

## Description
Iâ€™ve created a program that allows you to take notes and save them via a web app. Using express, I created a server that allows the user to take notes for homework, work, etc. and save them to the web app. The user will be able to access all of the saved notes whenever they feel like, unless they delete them using the trash can icon. This is a quick and easy way to keep yourself organized while you get through classes or during work so you can refer back to them while you study!
